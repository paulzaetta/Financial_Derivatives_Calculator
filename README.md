A first application will allow to evaluate options on equities, currencies, indices and futures according to several models. The models introduced will include the Black-Scholes model and the binomial model (for European and American options). But also models to evaluate less "traditional" options such as barrier and digital options. The valuation of the option will be combined by the evaluation of its "Greeks" (delta, gamma, theta, vega, rho). 

A second application will evaluate European options using log-normal, Merton jump diffusion and variance-gamma models using Monte-Carlo simulations. A dynamic chart will illustrate the Monte-Carlo simulation. 

A third application will allow the valuation of swaps by discounting at OIS (Overnight Indexed Average) rates. Forward rates (EURIBOR) will also be used and will also be integrated as program input. 

And finally, a fourth application will allow the bonds to be evaluated in a similar way to the previous application.
